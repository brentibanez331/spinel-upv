**COMELEC Organizational Information**  
The COMELEC is the principal government agency tasked by the Constitution to  
enforce and administer all laws and regulations concerning the conduct of regular and  
special elections. It is a body that is designed to be constitutionally independent from the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government to ensure the conduct of free, fair and honest elections. As an added measure, the constitution also grants fiscal autonomy to enable the COMELEC to operate effectively, efficiently and free from political interference. The constitution mandates that "funds certified by the Commission as necessary to defray the expenses for holding regular and special elections, plebiscites, initiatives, referenda, and recalls, will be provided in the regular or special appropriations and, once approved, will be released automatically upon certification by the Chairman of the Commission." 
 
**Judicial, Regulatory and Administrative Functions**  
In addition to its primary task of election administration, the COMELEC also performs judicial, regulatory and administrative functions. Its judicial mandate consists of taking exclusive original jurisdiction over all contests relating to the elections, returns, and qualifications of all elective regional, provincial, and city officials, and appellate jurisdiction over all contests involving elective municipal officials decided by trial courts of general jurisdiction, or involving elective barangay officials decided by trial courts of limited jurisdiction. Exception issues involving the right to vote, it has regulatory and administrative authority to decide on all questions affecting elections, including determination of the number and location of polling places, appointment of election officials and inspectors, and registration of voters.  

**Recommendatory Powers**  
The Commission has the power to propose to Congress measures to minimize election spending, including limitation of places where propaganda materials will be posted, and to prevent and penalize all forms of election frauds, offenses, malpractices, and nuisance candidacies. Likewise, it can recommend to the President the removal of any officer or employee it has deputized, or the imposition of any other disciplinary action, for violation or disregard of, or disobedience to, its directive, order, or decision. On its own, or upon verified complaint, the COMELEC can file petitions in court for inclusion or exclusion of voters and investigate/prosecute cases of violations of election laws, including acts or omissions constituting election frauds, offenses, and malpractices.  

**Membership**  
The COMELEC consists of one Chairman and 6 commissioners, all of whom have a  
7-year term without reappointment. In all matters pertaining to election administration and policymaking, the commissioners act as a collegial body. In election cases and pre-proclamation controversies, however, the Commission sits in two divisions initially, but  
decides en banc on motion to reconsider a division decision.  

**Offices and Departments**  
Assisting the Chairman in managing the day-to-day affairs and operations of the  
COMELEC is the Executive Director. As the highest-ranking career official, he implements the policies and decisions of the Commission, takes charge of the administrative affairs and serves as the communication and operational link between the staff and Commissioners. He is assisted by a Deputy Executive Director for Administration (DEDA) and a Deputy Executive Director for Operations (DEDO).  

**COMELEC Organizational Structure**  
The Commission is under the over-all control of the Chairman and the  
Commissioners, who constitute the policymaking body that lays down the guidelines and regulations for elections, referenda, plebiscites, initiatives and recalls. The Commission sits either en banc or in two divisions in order to expedite disposition of election cases including  pre-proclamation controversies.

**Management**  
The Chairman is the Chief Executive of the Commission. Under him is the Executive  
Director (ED) whose duty is to implement policies and decisions and to take charge of the administrative affairs of the Commission. Assisting the Executive Director are two deputies: a Deputy Executive Director for Administration (DEDA) and a Deputy Executive Director for Operations (DEDO).

**COMELEC Historical Background**  
The Commission on Elections was created by a 1940 amendment to the 1935 Constitution. Its membership was enlarged and its powers expanded by the 1973 and 1987 Constitutions. The Commission exercises not only administrative, but judicial and quasi-judicial powers.  

**The Executive Bureau**  
Before the creation of the Commission, supervision over the conduct of elections was vested in the Executive Bureau, an office under the Department of Interior and later directly vested in the Department itself when the Executive Bureau was abolished. There was, however, general dissatisfaction over the manner in which elections were conducted under the supervision of the Secretary of the Interior. There was growing suspicion that Secretaries of the Interior administered election laws not for the purpose of securing honest and free elections, but to serve the political interest of the party in power to which they belonged. They were never entirely free from suspicion of acting with partisan bias. The close official relationship between the president and the Secretary of the Interior  bred suspicion that elections served the incumbent Secretary's political interest. The Secretary of the Interior was directly responsible to the President and his tenure of office was dependent not only on the pleasure of the President, but also upon the President's own continuance in office. This set-up only induced increasing distrust in the verdict at the polls.  

**Statutory Commission**  
The situation impelled the National Assembly to propose the creation by  
constitutional amendment of a Commission on Elections composed of a Chairman and two members to take over the functions of the Secretary of the Interior relative to elections. By constitutional amendment ratified by the Filipino people in a plebiscite held on June 17, 1940, all functions heretofore exercised by the Secretary of the Interior relative to the conduct of elections were transferred to the Commission. However, as the amendment could not be made effective in time for the 1940 elections, the National Assembly through Commonwealth Act No. 607 created a statutory Commission on Elections, giving there to the same powers which the Commission would have under the Constitution. The act became effective upon its approval on August 22, 1940. The Commission immediately functioned on September 14, 1940, and supervised the December 10, 1940 elections.

**Constitutional Commission**  
The constitutional amendment creating the Commission was finally approved on December 2, 1940. On June 21, 1941, the Commonwealth Act No. 657 was enacted reorganizing the Commission as a constitutional body. The members of the statutory Commission continued as member of the constitutional Commission. The subordinate personnel, records, documents, and property together with its unexpected balance in the appropriation were likewise transferred to the newly-organized Commission.  
The Chairman and Members of the Commission had a term of nine years each - a member being replaced every three years- except those first appointed who were given nine, six and three-years terms, respectively. The 1973 Constitution enlarged the membership of the Commission from three to nine but reduced their term of office from nine to seven years.

The 1987 Constitution reduced the membership of the Commission from nine to  
seven but retained their term of seven years without reappointment. Of those first appointed, 3 members should hold office for seven years, 2 members for five years and the last 2 members for three years.  
They can be removed from office only by impeachment and are provided with  
salaries fixed by law which shall not be decreased during their term of office. These are the safeguards to ensure the independence of the Commission.

**Powers and Functions of the Comelec**

5. **The concerned voter registration applicant is finally considered a registered voter of the concerned locality.**

**Registration Requirements**

It is the policy of the Commission to establish a clean, complete, permanent and updated list of voters through the mandatory taking of photograph, fingerprints and signature (biometrics) in the registration process. This is declared in R.A. 10367.  

For this purpose, when a person comes in to apply for registration, his (or her) biometrics will be captured digitally. This simply means digital images (or pictures) of his (or her) photograph, fingerprints and signature will be taken (or captured) using COMELEC's Voter Registration Machine (VRM). The VRM is simply a desktop computer, with a digital camera, fingerprint scanner and signature pad attached to it. Biometrics capture becomes possible with the use of these high-tech equipment, and the Voter Registration System (VRS). There is at least one (1) VRM for each local COMELEC office nationwide. Depending on the number of registered voters in the district, city or municipality, there may be more than one (1) VRM.

However, due to the approval by the House of Representatives of a bill seeking to establish a National Identification System, which proposes only one ID for all government transactions, the generation and distribution of Voter ID cards have been put on hold by the Commission.  

**Registration FAQs**
**What is voter registration?**  
Registration refers to the act of accomplishing and filing of a sworn application by a qualified voter before the Election Officer of the city or municipality, where the applicant resides, and including the record in the book of voters upon approval by the Election Registration Board.  

**Why should I register myself as a voter?**  
If a person is not a registered voter, he cannot vote in an election. This means that you  
cannot participate in choosing who your next public officials will be. You also would not be able to run for public office if you are not a registered voter.  

**What are the requirements for registration?**  
The basic requirements for any Filipino citizen to register as a voter are simple: he must be at least 18 years old, and a resident of the Philippines for at least one year and of the   city/municipality wherein he intends to vote for at least 6 months prior to an election. There are also certain disqualifications prescribed by law which you should not possess.  

**Where should I go to register?**  
By law, filing of applications for registration shall be conducted at the Office of the Election Officer (OEO), your local COMELEC office. That happens during regular office hours. The COMELEC has allowed the setting up of at least one satellite registration center for every barangay. There are also satellite registration centers for Person with Disabilities (PWDs), Indigenous Cultural Communities (ICCs/IPs), Senior Citizens (SCs) and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), subject to certain conditions.

**How often do I need to register?**  
Under the present system of continuing registration, a qualified person needs to register only once. This registration is permanent, unless declared otherwise by law. Registering more than once constitutes an election offense. However, in cases when a voter transfers residence, he needs to apply for the transfer of his registration record. There are also instances when a registration record may become deactivated due to some reasons stated by law, the most common of which is the failure to vote in two successive regular elections. When this happens, the concerned voter needs to apply for the reactivation of his registration record.

**I am already a registered voter. I voted in the last 2023 Barangay and SK Elections.**

**Do I need to register again in order to vote in the 2025 National and Local Elections  
(NLE)?**  
No, registration needs to be done only once. Your registration is good for further elections as long as you keep it active by participating in the elections by voting. If your registration record gets deactivated, that's another story.

**How can I change my civil status in my registration record?**  
Voters who have gotten married after registering as a single person, or married voters whose marriage has been annulled or declared a nullity by a competent court, including those married voters whose spouses have died, may apply for a correction of entry in their registration voters. Concerned female voters whose family name may have been affected by such events may also file for a change of their name in their registration record.

**My registration record/voter ID has typographical or clerical errors. How do I go about having the incorrect information corrected?**  
A registered voter whose registration record contains incorrect entries, including wrong or misspelled name, birth date, birth place or typographical errors, may request for its  
correction at the concerned local COMELEC office.

**I have already moved residence to another city/municipality. How do I transfer my  
registration record to my new place of residence?**  
During the scheduled registration period, an application for the transfer of the concerned registration record may be filed with the local COMELEC office of the new place of residence.

**If a record was deactivated, how can a voter have it reactivated again?**  
During the next scheduled registration record, a voter with a deactivated registration record may file for the reactivation of his (or her) registration record with the local COMELEC office of the city/municipality where he (or she) is registered.

**iRehistro Compliance and Other Requirements**

accomplishment of the Application Form. It DOES NOT automatically mean approval of your application. Accomplishing the online form does not automatically make you a registered voter.

**Persons with Disabilities and Citizens**  
The COMELEC (Commission) is the constitutional body mandated to conduct an  
honest, orderly, peaceful and credible elections in the country. For almost a decade now, the Commission has continuously and tirelessly adopted a policy of inclusivity towards the vulnerable sectors of our society particularly to the members of the sectors of Persons with Disabilities, Senior Citizens, and even to pregnant voters. In 2008, COMELEC formed a Technical Working Group (TWG) with the Commission  
on Human Rights (CHR) and other non-government organizations to study the issues being experienced by Persons with Disability in their exercise of their right to suffrage.  In 2010, COMELEC began extending preferential treatment to Senior Citizens, Pregnant Voters and Persons With Disabilities, by designating polling places located at the ground floor of the voting centers or by providing them express lanes (Min. Res. 10-0326).  

The Commission also designated focal persons for the sector of Persons With Disabilities (Min. Res. 10-1134). In 2011, reaching out further, COMELEC established a stronger linkage by being a part of the Inter-agency and NGO Network on Empowering of Persons with Disabilities. The sectoral challenges in the exercise of the right to vote were pointed out during the various focus group discussions, researches, and meetings. Basic problems faced by the sector during registration and voting were then identified.   As a result, Resolution 9220 or the Guidelines for Registration of Persons with Disabilities was promulgated and Minute Resolution 11-0708 was issued amending the  
existing Certification/Attestation by Assistor to have a portion called "Supplementary Data (Persons with Disabilities/Sr. Citizens with Disabilities)." In the said supplementary data, the applicant shall identify and tick-off their disability and the assistance they need to enable the COMELEC to respond with particularity. Both were first implemented and used respectively during the National PWD Registration Week held on 18-23 July 2011 (Min. Res. 11-0623). 
Also, apart from the field offices, more accessible place which included SM Malls,  
plaza, barangay centers and other public places were utilized as registration centers. As a  
result, some 5,553 Persons with Disabilities were accommodated for registration.  
In 2012, due to the success of the registration efforts, COMELEC has conducted  
focused registrations for persons with disabilities by regions per month. These Special  
Registrations highlighted the preparations done and showcased how this advocacy for the right to suffrage of Persons with Disability was adopted by our field officials. From 18 July 2011 to 31 October 2012 where there were then 65,926 persons with disabilities voters. On 29 June 2012, COMELEC Resolution 9485 or the Rules and Regulations for Voting of Persons with Disability and for the Establishment of Accessible Polling Places in Connection with the May 13, 2013 Elections was promulgated. Determined to flesh out the provisions of Resolution 9485, Project EASE (Ensuring  
Accessibility of Schools on Elections) which aims to ensure that public schools used as  
voting centers for the 2013 Elections are user-friendly to all persons most specially to persons with disabilities was born. Audit Teams composed of the COMELEC, DPWH, DepEd, NCDA (National Council on Disability Affairs), LGU, UAP and PWD sector conducted of an initial accessibility audit. The observations during the audit were used in a write shop conducted by the Commission with technical guidance from the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) for the drafting of the guidelines for accessibility requirements.  

COMELEC saw to it that on Election Day (May 13, 2013) clustered precincts assigned for Persons with Disabilities voters were located at the ground floor of polling  
places for greater accessibility.  
The 2013 elections were lauded by several organizations as more inclusive of persons with disability compared to past elections, but also noted that much more needs to  
be done.  
It was also in 2012 when COMELEC expanded its efforts in championing inclusivity  
on the world wide web. After a workshop hosted by IFES in tandem with the NCDA and  
Philippine Web Accessibility Group (PWAG) the official COMELEC website was reformatted with the objective of making the electoral information accessible for Persons with Disabilities in accordance with the rules on website accessibility.  
Verily, COMELEC was one of the recipients of the PWD-friendly Website Awards  
during the 34th National Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation Week.  
With the enactment of Rep. Act No. 10366 (An Act Authorizing the COMELEC to  
Establish Precincts Assigned to Accessible Polling Places Exclusively for PWDs and Senior Citizens), COMELEC promulgated Res. No. 9763 which served as the Implementing Rules and Regulations therefor. In 2014, not only did COMELEC set another Special Registration Day for persons with disability and senior citizens and ordered that Express Lanes be established during regular registration days (Res. No. 9853), the Commission also exempted them from payment of legal fees for the issuance of the certified true copy of Voter Registration Records (CVL Form 1-B) or the Certification as a registered voter (Min. Res. 14-0837). Moreover, the COMELEC, in close coordination with the CHR, NCDA, Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability organizations, designed and implemented sensitivity trainings to persons performing electoral duties, including COMELEC field officers, members of the BEI and accredited Citizen’s Arms, to familiarize them with the needs and to address the attitudinal barriers faced by the members of these sectors (Resolution No. 9763). With the success of previous special registration days, the Commission has consistently followed through the years 2015 to 2018 the setting of a Special Registration Days for Persons with Disabilities and Senior Citizens via the following mandates: 

COMELEC Min. Res. Nos. 15-0448 and 15-0454 in 2015, Res. No. 10166 in 2016, Res. No. 9853 in 2017 and Res. 10417 in 2018. In 2016, in addition to the established APPs, the Commission piloted-tested the Emergency Accessible Polling Places (EAPPs) to ensure maximum participation of Persons with Disabilities and Senior Citizen voters including heavily pregnant voters was pilot-tested.  

This project shall be fully implemented in the forthcoming 2019 elections.  
During the recently concluded Barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan Elections  
(BSKE), the Commission promulgated Res. 10211 (General Instructions for the Electoral  
Board and Barangay Board of Canvassers) directing the Electoral Board members that  
Persons with Disability and Senior Citizens shall vote in Accessible Polling Places (APPs)  
located at the ground floor for easy access and at express lanes or priority lanes with proper signage inside the polling place. Looking beyond these needs, on 07 May 2018, COMELEC signed a Memorandum of Understanding with DILG, DOH and PHIL RED CROSS to provide voters, specially Persons with Disability, Senior Citizens, Pregnant 

Women and persons rendering election-related services with free, timely and effective basic first aid assistance, essential medicines and access to emergency medical services. To date, COMELEC is positive that with its policy of inclusivity it can continue to maximize the participation of Persons with Disabilities and Senior Citizens in the conduct of electoral exercises in the future. The Committee on Persons with Disabilities and Senior Citizens and its Technical Working Group are continuously studying and crafting new policies and projects towards the achievement of goal.  
In support of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability (CRPD),  
particularly their voting rights, the Commission joins hand with other government agencies and the United Nations today (December 03) in celebrating the INTERNATIONAL DAY OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES.  

**Persons with Disability and Senior Citizens Registration for 2020 Barangay and SK  
Elections**  
Pursuant to its mandate to devise systems and procedures that will enable Persons  
with Disability and Senior Citizens to register and vote by themselves, the Commission on Elections encourages eligible members of these sectors to register as voters. Those who are already registered are likewise encouraged to update their registration records. Through the Supplementary Data Form (Annex B), both new registrants and those who are already registered may notify the COMELEC of (1) their type of disability and (2) the  
form or assistance needed on Election Day. Using the same form, Persons with Disability and Senior Citizens may also signify their intent to vote in an Accessible Polling Place (APP). Unlike a regular polling place, an APP is a separate polling place exclusively for Persons with Disabilities and Senior Citizens who have manifested their intent to vote in this facility. It is located at the ground floor and near the entrance of the building, if possible. It is also free of any physical barriers and provided with necessary services, including assistive devices. On Election Day, voters in an APP will have the chance to cast their vote and personally feed their ballots to a Vote-Counting Machine or VCM assigned to the APP.

Those who choose not to avail of this option may vote in a regular polling precinct,  
where they will be prioritized through an Express Lane and also be able to personally feed their ballots into the VCM. However, those who did not fill out a Supplementary Data Form, did not update their records, or choose not to vote in an APP or a regular polling precinct may instead be accommodated in an Emergency-APP (E-APP). This type of polling place is distinct from an APP. Although the voter is still provided with the necessary services and facilities, an E-APP does not have a VCM assigned to it; hence, voters will be asked to entrust their ballots with the Electoral Board for batch-feeding to the VCM at a later time.

The following are eligible to update their registration records:
1.  Those who are not yet registered voters;
2.  Those who are already registered, but have not indicated their type of disability when they applied for registration; and
3.  Those who are already registered, but have developed or manifested their disability after having been registered.  

The registration records of Persons with Disabilities and Senior Citizens will be treated with utmost confidentiality. Persons with Disability and Senior Citizens may go to the Office of the Election Officer (OEO) from Mondays to Saturdays, 8:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M., including holidays, or in satellite registration centers until September 30, 2019. Assistors are available for those who cannot by themselves accomplish applications for
registration by reason of illiteracy or physical disability, subject to the provisions of COMELEC Resolution No. 9763.

**Indigenous People**  
In 2016, the Indigenous Peoples Voting Project piloted the concept of Separate Polling  
Places (SPPs) and Accessible Voting Centers (AVCs) in different Indigenous Peoples (IP)  
communities in the Mindoro Provinces. The IP Voting Project seeks to address the issues on access, discrimination, and "hakot" encountered by IP voters on election day.  
SPPs provide polling places that exclusively cater to IP voters in voting centers, thus  
providing a secure environment for IPs to vote. AVCs transfer IP voters from their existing voting centers to schools that are situated near their communities. AVCs make the voting process accessible to IPs and prevent them from being subjected to "hakot" on their way to distant voting centers. The polling places and voting centers were temporary such that the ballots of IP voters were merely collected from their original precincts and were brought to SPPs and AVCs for purpose of voting. The ballots are then returned to their original precincts for batch feeding and counting at the close of the designated voting hour.  

For the 2018 Barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan Elections (BSKE), the SPPs and AVCs  
were made permanent through the creation of IP Established Precincts. This gave the IP  
voters the opportunity to go through the complete process of voting and counting of votes.
